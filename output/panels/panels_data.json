Most big events already trade elsewhere; infra should make arbitrage seamless, not siloed.\n\nBinary markets on a HL style order book can be powerful but success depends on liquidity depth + arb pathways, not just the contract spec.\n\nHyperliquid.\nExpand\nrektdiomedes\n·7s\n@ rektdiomedes\nReplying to LFG lads 💪💪💪\nAndy\n@ ayyyeandy\nLIVE.\n\nhttps://t.co/dcTjnlfxzN\nIcoBeast.eth🦇🔊\n·9s\n@ beast_ico\nReplying to We love the dashboard - it's been really useful for tracking.\n\nSuper excited to have cleared the 1m credits threshold!\nJosh\n@ JDHyper\n1 Million credits = +100 ETH in Revenue!\n\nCurrent prices, that's +$460,000 in a couple months\n\nFew hundred returning buyers a day and seeing a 51% increase in Rev compared to last week\nExpand\nMemeCoinTracker (MCT)\n·9s\n@ MemeCoin_Track\nReplying to Geopolitical risk = BTC upside.
